# Getting Started

## Load card image

- Upload your card image into the tool.
- Desktop: Click the drag area or drag and drop from your local file system.
- Mobile: Click the drag area to either upload a photo or take a new one.

:::tip[Card Alignment]
Try to get the card as straight on and flat as possible when taking the picture. If the card isn't laying flat you can put it in a penny sleeve + semi-rigid card saver.

The example is skewed for demo purposes of the perspective transform.
:::

## Drag the outer borders
Using the corner endpoints drag the border to outline the outer edges of the card as closely as possible.

- Depending on how far the drag points are you may have to go around the card twice to get an exact fit.
- Once the outer border is aligned you can move to the right image (bottom on mobile) to measure the inner borders.

</div>
</>

## Drag the inner borders
Drag anywhere along the lines to align the edge of the lines with the inner border of the card.

## Review Results
- You can now review the position of the borders, ratios and estimated grades.
- Different grading companies have different requirements for both the front and the back so make sure you review the proper tab + grades.

:::tip[Border Alignment]
Always be consistent in how you measure the card. You can measure the inside, outside, or center of the border, and as long as you do that on all sides you will end up with similar results.
